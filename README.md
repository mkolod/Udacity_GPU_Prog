# Udacity_GPU_Prog
My work related to the Udacity Introduction to Parallel Programming, CS 344. I am taking this course on Udacity to improve my knowledge of GPU Parallel programming, and after nearly every set of lectures, there are problem sets that enable the student to practic the skills learned. Here, I have listed assignments and ways I've gone beyond the assignments to explore more advanced features of CUDA such as shared memory, optimizing block/grid size, etc. that is not necessarily a part of the main problem set.
